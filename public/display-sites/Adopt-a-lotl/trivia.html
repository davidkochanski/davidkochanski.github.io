            <h2>Axolotl Trivia</h2>
            <div id = "first">
                <img class = "trivia-buttons" id = "first-btn" src = "images/arrow-right.png" alt = ">">
                <h3 id = "first-head" class = "trivia-heads">What colour are axolotls naturally?</h3>

                <h3 id = "second-head" class = "trivia-heads">How many axolotls are left in the wild?</h3>
            </div>


            <p id = "first-p" class = "trivia-ps" style = "display: none;">Axolotls are brownish-black with a slight olive hue in the wild. Axolotls are almost never white/pink naturally, that is the result of selected breeding!</p>
            <p id = "second-p" class = "trivia-ps" style = "display: none;">Unfortunately, less than 1000 axolotls are left in the wild. This means that they are Critically Endangered, according to the IUCN Red List.</p>


            <div id = "third">
                <img class = "trivia-buttons" id = "third-btn" src = "images/arrow-right.png" alt = ">" style = "clear: both;">
                <h3 id = "third-head" class = "trivia-heads">Where does the name "Axolotl" come from?</h3>
            </div>
            <div id = "fourth">
                <img class = "trivia-buttons" id = "fourth-btn" src = "images/arrow-right.png" alt = ">">
                <h3 id = "fourth-head" class = "trivia-heads">Axolotls are native to how many places in the world?</h3>
            </div>


            <p id = "third-p" class = "trivia-ps" style = "display: none;">The name "Axolotl" comes from the Ancient Aztecs, and their name can be literally translated to "Water Dog."</p>
            <p id = "fourth-p" class = "trivia-ps" style = "display: none;">Axolotls are only naturally found in one place in the entire world, Lake Xochimilico, which is just outside of Mexico City, Mexico.</p>
