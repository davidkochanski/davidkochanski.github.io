                <h3>What is an Axolotl?</h3>
                <p class = "no-shadow">The Axolotl, (pronounced <i>AX-suh-LOT-ul</i>) also known as the Mexican Salamander, is a small amphibian creature native to a small part of Mexico.

            <div class = "third default">
                <h3>Are Axolotls Dangerous?</h3>
                <p class = "no-shadow">Nope! While they are predators &ndash; preying on smaller fish by attacking them with their mouths &ndash; the worst you'll get is a nibble from them.</p> 
                <p class = "no-shadow">Just stay on their good side!</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Why should I care about getting a pet Axolotl?</h3>
                <p class = "no-shadow">Axolotls are adorable salamanders that not many people know exist. They're fun to look at, and they can be a great companion. They live quite long on average (10-15 years), and for non-beginners, they are the perfect aquatic pet that is a blend between exotic, but still attainable and hospitable.</p>
